				What is waste management and why is it important?
			</h1>
			<p class="text-color leading-7 pb-12 text-[#9badad] text-md ">
				Waste management is one of the most crucial problems our country
				is facing right now. India produces 62 million tonnes of waste
				each year. When we segregate waste, there is not only a
				reduction of waste that gets landfilled, it also reduces
				pollution levels by lowering the percentage of garbage exposed
				to air and water. WM is important because it reduces the effect
				of pollution on the environment and nature. It can also help
				reduce or reuse the waste materials that are harmful for the
				environment such as plastic, glass, Styrofoam, thermocol, etc.
				and many more.

				What is dry waste and wet waste?
			</h1>
			<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-[#a4b2c4]">
				Dry Waste:
			</h2>
			<p class="text-color leading-7 mb-2 text-[#6d7f7f]">
				Dry waste consists of waste that does not decay. It is also
				known as waste which cannot be biodegradable. Dry waste consists
				of paper, glass, thermocol, Styrofoam, rubber, metal, cloth,
				empty bottles, stationeries, etc. and can be recycled into new
				products further. Before segregating, sharp materials like glass
				and other metals shall be kept in a separate bag/container.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-[#a4b2c4]">
				Wet Waste:
			</h2>
			<p class="text-color leading-7 mb-12 text-[#6d7f7f]">
				Wet waste is all the kitchen waste that we produce. Eg:
				vegetable peels, used tea bags, fruits, leftovers, coconut
				shells, flowers, leaves, meat or nonveg, expired food items,
				bread, biscuits, etc.
			</p>

				Waste segregation :-
			</h1>
			<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-[#a4b2c4]">
				Why is waste segregation necessary?
			</h2>
			<p class="text-color leading-7 mb-8 text-[#6d7f7f]">
				By segregating dry waste such as plastic, glass, metals, paper,
				etc. from wet waste it becomes easier to recycle them into new
				products. Whereas wet waste like vegetable leftovers, fruits,
				used tea bags etc. can be used for producing gas.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-[#a4b2c4]">
				Segregation of waste at home:
			</h2>
			<p class="text-color leading-7 mb-8 text-[#6d7f7f]">
				Segregation of dry waste and wet waste can be done from home.
				This habit will reduce the burden of the municipal authorities
				to segregate the waste. To get started with it, you just need
				some awareness and the desire to act towards this.
			</p>

			<h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#558acb]">
				What is Waste Segregation?
			</h1>
			<p class="text-color leading-7 mb-8 text-[#6d7f7f]">
				Waste segregation is the process of separating different types
				of waste materials in order to make it easier to recycle,
				compost, or dispose of them properly. This process is an
				important step in reducing the amount of waste that ends up in
				landfills and promoting a more sustainable environment.
			</p>

			<h2 class="text-lg font-semibold mb-2 text-[#a4b2c4]">
				Segregation at the individual and community level
			</h2>
			<p class="text-color leading-7 mb-8 text-[#6d7f7f]">
				Segregating waste can be done at the individual level, such as
				separating recyclables from other trash in your own home, or at
				the community level, through programs that collect different
				types of waste at the curb. Many cities and towns have curbside
				pickup programs for recycling and composting, and residents are
				often provided with separate bins for different types of waste.
			</p>

			<h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#558acb]">
				Benefits of Waste Segregation
			</h1>
			<p class="text-color leading-7 mb-8 text-[#6d7f7f]">
				By segregating waste, we can reduce the amount of waste that
				ends up in landfills, conserve resources, and reduce greenhouse
				gas emissions. It also makes it easier for WM companies to
				recycle and compost materials, rather than having to sort
				through mixed waste.
			</p>

			<h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#558acb]">
				Conclusion: wet garbage and dry garbage
			</h1>
			<p class="text-color leading-7 mb-8 text-[#6d7f7f]">
				Wet waste and Dry waste segregation are necessary for every
				individual because they will help us keep our environment
				pollution-free and also keep the environment healthy. These
				segregated wastes can be reused and especially plastic waste can
				be recycled into new products and plastic granules.
